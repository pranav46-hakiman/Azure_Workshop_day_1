-> What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing transmits computer services over the internet to enable faster innovation and accessing more flexible resources. In other words, Cloud Computing is like renting computer 
power from a remote location, instead of owning your own physical servers.

A real life example, you can rent a vehicle instead of owning it.

-> Benefits of Cloud Computing:


1. Availablity: It allows one to access and operate cloud service for a period of time.
2. Scalablity: It means to adapt to changes based on the requirements.
3. Cost-Efffective : It offers a pay-as-you-go model.

-> Types of Clouds:

1. Public Clouds: 
Public Cloud ia a service where we can get access to the resources like servers, storage and networking over the internet. Here, we need to go to the website of the cloud provider
[like Microsoft Azure, AWS] and build the resource.

2. Private Cloud:
Private cloud is similar to Public Cloud, but the only difference between public and private cloud is that private cloud are only accessible to a single organization or one who
owns the servers, networks,etc.
Example: 

3. Hybrid Cloud:
Hybrid Cloud is the combination of both public Cloud and Private Cloud.

-> What is On-Premises?
Software is installed and executed on the servers owned by the organization. Applications and data can be only accessed within the network of the organization. 

Advantages:
1. Security
2. Performance
3. Compilance

Diadvantages:
1. Higher costs:
2. Limited Scalability:

-> Types of Cloud service providers:

1. Infrastructure as a service: [IaaS]
IaaS is a service that providers the customer with storage, servers and networks over the internet.
Example: Azure, AWS, GCP

2. Platform as a service: [PaaS]
PaaS is a service where the cloud service providers lets the customers to deploy, develop and create resources.
Example: Azure web apps

3. Software as a service: [SaaS]
We don't need to install any software in our PC or download it, Instead we can access it through the internet.
Example: Microsoft Office 365

-> Difference between IaaS, PaaS, SaaS:

Iaas:
1. System admins uses it.
2. Data center to store information.
3. We get access only to Storage, Servers and Networks

PaaS:
1. Used by the developers.
2. Tools to create, develop, and deploy.
3. we get access to Storage, Servers, Virtual Machines, Networks, OS, and Runtime.

SaaS:
1. Used by the Customers.
2. We can access software applications over the internet.
3. We get access to all.

-> Azure:

Azure is one of the largest cloud service providers in the world. It offers you the flexibility to use the tools to create, deploy and manage applications on a large network. It provides
a wide-range of resources.

-> Core Architectural Components of Azure:

1. Azure Regions: Azure regions are geographical locations around the world where Micsrosoft maintains data centers for its cloud computing services. 
   Example: regions in India are Pune, chennai and Mumbai.

2. Azure Sovereign Regions: They are not managed by Microsoft and may have restrictions to certain customers. These regions are isolated.
   Example: US, Germany and China.

3. Azure Resources: A resource is something that is used to manage services in azure.
   Examples: Virtual Machines [VM]

4. Azure Data Centers:  Datacentres are like a group of networked computer servers.
   Examples: North central [US], Japan west, etc.

5. Azure Suscription: We get access to deploy and consume the azure resources. It can be purchased and used for a period of time.
   Types: --> Free Trial
          --> Pay-as-you-go

6. Azure policies: It allows one to govern the azure resources.
